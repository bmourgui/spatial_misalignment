# Details on parameters used to describe species-environmental relationships
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Here, we present how we derived the three ecological parameters (Fig. S1.1) describing species-environment relationships (i.e. the environmental optimum $\theta$, the maximum probability of presence $\psi_{max}$, the SER width $\omega$) from the regression coefficients. 

```{r figS1.1, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Illustration of a bell-shaped species-environment relationship with three associated ecological parameters: the maximum probability of presence $\\psi_{max}$, the environmental optimum $\\theta$ and the ecological width $\\omega$."}
knitr::include_graphics(path = here::here("results", "img", "figS1.png"))
```

The regression modelling SER was specified as:
$$logit(\psi) = f(X) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2X^2$$
with $\psi$ the probability of presence, $X$ the environmental value and $\beta$s the regression coefficients. 

## Environmental optimum ($\theta$)
The environmental optimum is the environmental value associated with the maximum probability of presence. $\theta$ is reached when the derivative of the regression equals zero:
\begin{align}
f'(\theta) &= 0 \\ 
\beta_1 + 2\beta_2\theta &= 0 \\ 
\theta &= \frac{-\beta_1}{2\beta_2}.
\end{align}


## Maximum probability of presence ($\psi_{max}$)
$\psi_{max}$ the maximum probability of presence is reached at environmental optimum. Thus we have:
\begin{align}
logit(\psi_{max}) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1\theta + \beta_2\theta^2 \\ 
\psi_{max} &= \frac{exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1\theta + \beta_2\theta^2)}{1 + exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1\theta + \beta_2\theta^2)}, \text{ with: }\theta  = \frac{-\beta_1}{2\beta_2}.
\end{align}


## SER width ($\omega$)

$\omega$ the ecological width is a measure of the species ecological breadth (i.e. ecological tolerance) and is defined, for a bell-shaped SER, as the environmental distance between two points of the curve having a probability of presence of 0.05 (Michaelis & Diekmann, 2017). We denote this probability of presence as $\psi_{\omega} = 0.05$. Let's set $x_1$ and $x_2$ the solutions of the equation $\psi_{\omega} = 0.05 \Leftrightarrow \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \beta_2X^2 = logit(0.05)$, then we have: 
\begin{align}
\omega &= \lvert x_1 - x_2 \rvert \\
\omega &= \lvert \frac{-\beta_1 + \sqrt{\Delta}}{2\beta_2} - \frac{-\beta_1 - \sqrt{\Delta}}{2\beta_2} \rvert \\
\omega &= \lvert \frac{\sqrt{\Delta}}{\beta_2} \rvert
\end{align}
with $\Delta = \beta_1^2 - 4\beta_0'\beta_2 = \beta_1^2 - 4(\beta_0 - log(\frac{0.05}{1-0.05}))\beta_2$.

## Loss of fine-grain heterogneity when coarsening environmental data.

For a given cell $i$ we defined fine-grain heterogeneity (i.e. intra cell variability $V^{intra}_i$) as the variance in point-level environmental values $X_{j(i)}$ within the cell:
$$V^{intra}_i = \frac{1}{J_i -1} \sum_{j=1}^{J_i}(X_{j(i)} - X_i)^2 $$
with $J_i$ the number of points within cell $i$ and $X_i$ the environmental value of cell $i$. To summarise it over the study area, we compute the mean:
$$\overline{V^{intra}_i} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_i^N V^{intra}_i$$
with $N$ the number of cell in the study area. Finally to visualise the loss of fine-grain heterogeneity we plot the evolution of $1 - \overline{V^{intra}_i}$ with the increase of the grain size.
