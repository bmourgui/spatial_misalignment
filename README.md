> Dealing with grain mismatch between response and explanatory variables in species distribution models.

This work, based on simulations, investigates the area-to-point misalignment problem that can occur when studying species distributions. Area-to-point misalignment is defined as a mismatch between the resolution of explanatory variables (e.g. climatic descriptors) coarser than the resolution of the response variable (e.g. presence-absence of a species). We show that area-to-point misalignment reduce accuracy and predictive ability of SDMs if not accounted for. We also propose a Berkson error model as a potential solution and future avenue of research in SDM based studies.
